An iOS app written in Swift that check hockey scores. Inspired by [Jason Leyrerâ€™s](http://twitter.com/sigsegfalt) excellent [HockeyScores](https://github.com/jleyrer/HockeyScores). Powered by [HockeyStreams.com](https://www.hockeystreams.com/api#scoresapi)

##Notes

###Feb. 15, 2015

The code has now been modified to use 1.2 goodness like chained optionals.

###Feb. 9, 2015 Update

This now builds under Swift 1.2, but I haven't looked at the code for correctness with all the changes to optional semantics.
