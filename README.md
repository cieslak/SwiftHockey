##Notes

###Feb. 9, 2015 Update

This now builds under Swift 1.2, but I haven't looked at the code for correctness with all the changes to optional semantics.

###Original

It’s pretty rudimentary and ugly, but I just wanted to see how quickly I could get a functioning Swift app out. Also, it’s probably not very good Swift.
