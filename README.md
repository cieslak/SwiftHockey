##Description

An iOS app written in Swift that check hockey scores. Inspired by [Jason Leyrer’s](http://twitter.com/sigsegfalt) excellent [HockeyScores](https://github.com/jleyrer/HockeyScores).

##Notes

It’s pretty rudimentary and ugly, but I just wanted to see how quickly I could get a functioning Swift app out. Also, it’s probably not very good Swift.
